In-Class Assignment - Simulating Server Latency

Build a simple Flask server in class and test it using your browser. 
Try the following:

Get a "hello world" example running just like you see in the Flask quickstart.
Introduce a sleep delay in the hello_world(). 
You can use code like this:

# At the top of your app.py
import time

# Before the return statement in hello_world()
time.sleep(5)


Interact with your Flask server (browser, curl, etc.) and observe the delayed response. 
You will be inserting a delay like this into your POST method in the activity logging microservice for the homework due this week.
